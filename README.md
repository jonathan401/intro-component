## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand a little bit better how form validation works. It also tested my
CSS skills a lot more. I had to build out a one column layout for mobile ands tablet screens and a two column layout for wider screens.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

- [Password visibility toggle placement](https://www.csestack.org/hide-show-password-eye-icon-html-javascript/) - This article helped me place the eye visibility icon on the password input field
- [Password Reges pattern](https://gist.github.com/HarishChaudhari/0dd5514ce430991a1b1b8fa04e8b72a4) - This is was where I got the regex pattern for the a strong password from. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept..
- [Placing images in input fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C86JVJd2no) - This youtube video helped me to place the error icons in the input field
